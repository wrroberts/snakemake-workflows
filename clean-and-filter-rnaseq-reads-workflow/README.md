# Snakemake Workflow: 
# Clean and Filter RNAseq reads

### Overview
This workflow performs RNAseq read correction, trimming, and filtering to remove reads aligning to common laboratory vectors, rRNA, and organelles. It is designed to ensure reproducibility through version-controlled code, conda environments, and modular rule-based execution.
